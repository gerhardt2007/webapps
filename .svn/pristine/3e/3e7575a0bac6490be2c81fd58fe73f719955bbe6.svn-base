<h1>The Dribble Promise</h1>
<p class='subhead'>We believe the cleaning industry is ripe for change. The typical experience with a maid service involves phone calls, a house visit to get a quote and a volley of texts and emails to schedule the actual cleaning. That is a lot of time wasted, when you could be building hipster cred by discovering new indie bands with names like Angry Salad or drinking coffee farmed from civets.</p>
<p class='subhead'>Here at Dribble, we think the experience of getting your house cleaned should feel more like going to your favorite spa -- easy, rejuvenating and something that brings a smile to your face. Scheduling your cleaning is simple. Just tell us your home size and address, pick a time that works for you, enter your payment details, and you are done! We even take care of the tip for you, based on the rating you give our cleaners, so there is no need to leave cash on your kitchen counter. And if it turns out you are not 100% satisfied, we will come back and clean your home again for free. After all, our mission is to get your place *five star hotel* clean, every time. You know, in a boutique, hipster five star hotel kind of way.</p>

<div class='profile'>I graduated from the best technician university of Ukraine. Summary, I have worked in IT more then 7 years. My last job was in large telecommunication company Ukrtelecom Joint Stock Company (www.ukrtelecom.ua) where I had worked for 4 years. At that time I was resolving interesting and often no easy tasks...  So, I&prime;ve got a great experience.
Then fate gave me a present: I won the Green Card and got the opportunity to live in beautiful Silicon Valley. Now I live in San Jose.
I have passion for programming, Unix-like operating systems, relational databases, JAVA-technologies, web services.</div>
